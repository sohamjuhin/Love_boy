Automatic custom love latter writer  web based tool


Creating an automatic custom love letter writer web-based tool involves building a web application that generates personalized love letters based on user inputs. In this example, I'll provide a simplified version using the Flask web framework. You can expand upon this basic structure to create a more comprehensive tool.

1. **Install Flask:**

If you don't have Flask installed, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

2. **Create the Web Application:**

Create a new file named `app.py` and add the following code:



3. **Create Templates:**

Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory as `app.py`, and within that folder, create a file named `index.html` with the following content:



4. **Run the Application:**

In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing `app.py` and run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will start, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You'll be able to input the recipient's name and the date, and the app will generate a love letter for you.

Please note that this is a simple example, and you can enhance it by adding more customization options, a broader variety of sample messages, and improving the user interface.
